# Nodestagram

This project started because I wanted to use instagram's API in node.js and there were no libraries yet.

Since everything is so fresh spanking new, forks/pull-requests much appreciated.

# License

Some sort of BSD or MIT license,  the general idea being:

- this is open source
- you must give credit where credit is due
- not viral such as GPL
- you still can't change the license though
